Project 4: Exploring Neural Connectivity  
Problem Description
 
The purpose of this project is to analyze the connectivity of a neural cluster. The neural cluster will be made from scratch using
the Hodgkin-Huxley model. This mathematical model provides a set of nonlinear differential equations to reproduce the realistic
propagation of action potentials within neurons. This model will allow us to account for physical chemistry and electrical conductance
of a single neuron. In the first stage of the application development, we will develop a single neuron according to this model.
After successfully generating multiple standalone neurons, the cells will be linked together to form a cluster. We aim to simulate
the neural cluster to answer the following questions: 
1. How quickly does information propagate from the first cell to the last neural cell? 
 
2. Is there a specific configuration of cells that increases the rate of information propagation?
For example, how much more quickly does information get sent if cells are chained in a list versus a tree structure?
